# 15, SeaHorn, confirmed pointer related bug
```
Me:

#include  "seahorn/seahorn.h"
#include <string.h>

void foo(char *p, unsigned long *r) {
  unsigned long n0 = strlen(p);
  *r = n0;
}

int main() {
  char a[4] = "";
  strcpy(a, "123");
  unsigned long n2;  
  foo(a, &n2);
  sassert(n2 == 3);
  return 0;
}

In this case, I run sea bpf -m64 --promote-nondet-undef=false example.c.
I don't understand why SeaHorn gave the unexpected result sat. Is it related to the pointer parameter of function foo()?

```
```
Developer:

Btw, I should have said that you should run bpf --bmc=opsem which runs the bounded model checker
but with a more precise modeling of the C semantics.

In any case, if you run sea bpf --bmc=opsem  --promote-nondet-undef=false ../test_505.c

Warning: unhandled instruction:   %_2 = call i32 @strlen(i8* noundef nonnull dereferenceable(1) %_1) #8 @ entry in main (BvOpSem2.cc:3433)

so strlen is treated as a nondeterministic call which is not precise enough to prove your assertion.


```
