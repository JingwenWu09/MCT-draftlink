# 4, CPAchecker, confirmed interprocedural analysis related bug
```
Me:

struct S {
	int (*p)(int, int);
};

int add(int a, int b) {
	return a + b;
}

int main() {
	int a = 1;
	int b = 2;
	struct S s = {add};
	assert( (*s.p)(a, b) == 3 );
	return 0;
}

In this example, the assert() functions is true, which is confirmed by compiling with gcc and clang.
The predicate analysis and k-induction of CPAchecker both give the TRUE result,
while the value analysis gives the UNKNOWN result.
Command line: scripts/cpa.sh -valueAnalysis -64 -preprocess filename.c
```
```
Developer:

The component that tracks function-pointers currently does not handle structs etc.
In simple cases like here it would be feasible to add support for it.
