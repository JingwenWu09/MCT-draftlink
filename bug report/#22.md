# 11, SeaHorn, confirmed undefined behaviour related bug
```
Me:

Example 1:
#include "seahorn/seahorn.h"
int main(){
	int x = 2147483647;
	int y = 2147483647;

	for(int i=0; i<1; i++){
		x++;
	}
	for(int i=0; i<1; i++){
		y++;
	}

	sassert(x == -2147483648);	//sat
	sassert(y == -2147483648); //sat
	sassert(x == y);	//sat

	return 0;
}


Example 2:
#include "seahorn/seahorn.h"
int main(){	
	int x = 2147483646;
	int y = 2147483646;

	for(int i=0; i<2; i++){
		x++;
	}
	for(int i=0; i<2; i++){
		y++;
	}

	sassert(x == -2147483648);	//sat
	sassert(y == -2147483648);  //sat
	sassert(x == y);	//unsat

	return 0;
}

In these two examples, the verification result of each "sassert" statement is as stated in the comment.
Each assertion should be hold which is confirmed by gcc and clang,
while seahorn gives some unexpected results. And I have some questions:

Why does sassert(x == y) produce different results in these two examples?
Why do sassert(x == -2147483648) and sassert(y == -2147483648) both give the sat result?
```
```
Developer:

Again, these programs have signed integer overflows which is undefined behavior.
If LLVM can detect such cases then it can do whatever it wants with the code.
