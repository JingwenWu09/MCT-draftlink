# 14, SeaHorn, confirmed language and library constructs related bug
```
Me:
#include  "seahorn/seahorn.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  FILE *f = fopen("fred.txt", "w");
  fwrite("hello\nhello\n", 1, 12, f);
  fclose(f);

  int InChar = 0;
  char ShowChar = '\0';
  f = fopen("fred.txt", "r");

  int InChar_1 = InChar;
  FILE * f_1 =  fopen("fred.txt", "r");
  char ShowChar_1 = ShowChar;
  while ((InChar = fgetc(f)) != EOF) {
    ShowChar = InChar;
    if(0) {
      ShowChar = '.';
    }
  }

  while ((InChar_1 = fgetc(f_1)) != EOF) {
    ShowChar_1 = InChar_1;
  }
  
  sassert(InChar == InChar_1) ;
  sassert(ShowChar == ShowChar_1) ;
  fclose(f);

  return 0;
}

In this case, these two assertions should be true while seahorn gives sat result with command sea bpf -m64 --bmc=opsem FILE.c.
Does seahorn not support file read and write operations such as fopen, fget, fwrite, fclose?

```
```
Developer:
Reasoning about file contents is beyond what SeaHorn can do.
