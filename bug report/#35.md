# 8, CPAchecker, fixed language and library constructs related bug
```
Me:

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    assert(argc == 1);
	return 0;
}

In this example, the assert() functions are both true, which is confirmed by compiling with gcc and clang, while CPAchecker gives the FALSE result which means the assertion is false. Is there no way for CPAchecker to process the relevant information from the external inputï¼Ÿ

Command line:
scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -64 -preprocess -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false <file_name.c>

```
```
Developer:

Your example has only one assert call, and it checks argc == 1,
but this is not guaranteed to be true. So the result happens to be correct.
But in fact we do not model argc and argv at all right now.
I wasn't requested so far, and I guess must users model input to the verification tasks
via calls to __VERIFIER_nondet_* instead of command-line arguments.
```
