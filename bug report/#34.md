# 7, CPAchecker, fixed language and library constructs (& interprocedural analysis) related bug
```
Me:

union U {float t[2]; double val;};
struct A {unsigned int a, b, c;};
struct A bar(void) {
  return (struct A){176, 52, 31};
}

void main() {
  struct A d;
  d = ({ ({ bar(); }); });
  struct A *a = &d;
  union U u = {{1.0, 1.0}};
  double x, y;
  if (a->a == 176 &&
    a->b == 52 && a->c == 31)
      x = u.val; 
  else exit(0);
  if (a->a == 176) y = u.val;
  assert (x == y);
}

In this example, the assert() functions is true, which is confirmed by compiling with gcc and clang, while CPAchecker gives the FALSE result in predicateAnalysis and kInduction which means the assertion is false. Please help me to explain why it happens, thanks.

Command line:
scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -64 -preprocess -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false <file_name.c>
scripts/cpa.sh -kInduction -64 -preprocess -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false <file_name.c>

```
```
Developer:
Initialization of union does not store values for all members in predicate analysis.
This was fixed a few days ago in f2470ec3.
