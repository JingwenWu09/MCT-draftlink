# 16, CPAchecker, fixed memory allocation related bug
```
Me:

int main(void) {
  char *p;
  p = "abc";
  while( *p != 'c'  ){  //source code's smg: false
    p++;
  }
  return 0;
}

In this case, SMGAnalysis on the latest source code and release version gave different results
(source code was FALSE and release was TRUE). Here is the Counterexample.1.core.txt of source code.

line 5:	N4 -{while}-> N5
line 5:	N5 -{[(*p) != 'c']}-> N6

I combined the declaration char *p; and the assignment p = "abc";  to form statement char *p = "abc", to get another one.
Then SMGAnalysis in both methods gave TRUE results.

In this case, which reslut is correct and what has been fixed in the wrong one?
Why does the SMGAnalysis of the source code give different results for the different assignment method,
is it related to the way the pointer p is assigned?

command line:
./scripts/cpa.sh -smg -spec ./config/properties/valid-memsafety.prp -preprocess -64 <filename.c>

```

Developer:

This is a bug in both SMG and SMG2. Thank you for reporting this!
I will take a look and fix it soon. I'll report back here.
