# 9, CPAchecker, language and library constructs related bug
```
Me:

int main(){
	double result = pow(2, 5);
	assert(fabs(result - 32) < 0.000001);
}

In this case, the assert() function is true, which is confirmed by compiling with gcc and clang,
while CPAchecker gives the FALSE result which means the assertion is false.

Command: ~/cpachecker/scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -64 -preprocess
-setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false <file_name.c>

```
```
Developer:

Linked to Support more floating point functions from C standard in predicate analysis.
The functions pow and fabs are currently not implemented in the predicate analysis.
There is an existing issue for the general topic of float-related functions,
so we'll keep track of this under that other issue.
