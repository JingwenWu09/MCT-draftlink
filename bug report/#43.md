# 16, CPAchecker, fixed memory allocation related bug
```
Me:

struct S { 
  const char *s; 
  int i; 
};
void foo(void) {
  struct S d1[2], d2[2];
  unsigned i; char a = 1;
  for(i = 0; i < sizeof(d1); i++){
    ((char *)&d1)[i] = a;
  }
  for(i = 0; i < sizeof(d2); i++){
    ((char *)&d2)[i] = 1;
  }
  assert (d1[0].i == d2[0].i);
}

I used ./scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -preprocess -64 <filename.c> to verify these three examples.
This example generated UNKNOWN result with the following message:

Error: Refinement failed: Interpolation failed in solver MATHSAT5 with message 'uncolorable Array proof'.
(RefinementFailedException.forInterpolationFailureInSolver, SEVERE)

```
```
Developer:

The error message produced shows that the problem is because the used SMT solver failed
when it was asked to compute interpolants. Interpolants for arrays are known to be incomplete in MathSAT,
but exactly which cases work and which don't depends on internals of MathSAT and is unknown to us.
Unfortunately we currently do not have a better interpolating SMT solver.
