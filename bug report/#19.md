# 8, SeaHorn, confirmed combined undefined behaviour related bug
```
Me:
example1.c

#include  "seahorn/seahorn.h"
struct S {
  unsigned y;
  unsigned x;
};
int f() {
  return 0;
}
int main() {
  struct S s;
  struct S s_1 = s;

  if(0) {
  	;
  } else if( f() == 0 ) {
  	;
  }
  
  if( 0 || f() == 0 ) {
  	;
  }

  sassert(s.y == s_1.y) ;
  return 0;
}

example2.c

#include  "seahorn/seahorn.h"
struct S {
  unsigned y;
  unsigned x;
};

int main() {
  struct S s;
  struct S s_1 = s;
  sassert(s.y == s_1.y) ;
  return 0;
}
In these two examples, I ran "sea bpf -m64 <filename.c>" , then example1.c generated sat result whileexample2.c generated unsat result.
The difference between the two examples is that example2.c is obtained by example1.c
after removing function f() and two if() blocks that have no effect on the result of running the program.

Since the deleted code has no effect on the result of the program's assert() statement,
why does SeaHorn gave a different result? 
```
```
Developer:
The two programs has undefined behavior. In the second program, the compiler detects that s and s_1 are not initialized
and therefore the assertion is removed. Please note the message printed by SeaHorn:

WARNING: no assertion was found so either program does not have assertions or frontend discharged them.
unsat

The message says that there is no assertion.
You can use the option --oll=test.ll to see the LLVM bitcode that is analyzed by SeaHorn.
The first program has also undefined behavior but the compiler decides to keep the assertion.
```
