# 13, CPAchecker, fixed combined complex structures related bug
```
Me:

struct A{
	int x;
};

struct B{
	struct A arrA[2];
};

int main(){
	struct B s= {{{1}}};
	struct B s1 = s;
	assert(s1.arrA[0].x == 1);
	return 0;
}


In this case, struct B has a structured array member struct A. The assert() function is true,
which is confirmed by compiling with gcc and clang,
while CPAchecker gives the FALSE result using the following commands which means the assertion is false.

Command:
1)scripts/cpa.sh -kInduction -preprocess -64 -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false test.c
2)scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -preprocess -64 -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false test.c
3)scripts/cpa.sh -valueAnalysis -preprocess -64 -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false test.c
4)scripts/cpa.sh -default -preprocess -64 -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false test.c
OS: Ubuntu22.04
Whether there is wrong when initializing a struct variable that contains structured array members?

```

Developer:
I can reproduce this with CPAchecker 2.2, but not with the current development version.
So it seems we have fixed this already.
