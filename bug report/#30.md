# 3, CPAchecker, confirmed undefined behaviour related bug
```
Me:

int main(){
	int a;
	int a_1 = a;
	assert(a == a_1);
	return 0;
}

In Example.c, CPAchecker gave both TRUE results in kInduction and predicateAnalysis
while gave UNKNOWN result in valueAnalysis.
Please help me to explain why the result of valueAnalysis is different form the others.
Is it related that the variable 'a' is uninitialized?

command:
scripts/cpa.sh -kInduction -64 -preprocess -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false <file_name.c>
scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -64 -preprocess -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false <file_name.c>
scripts/cpa.sh -valueAnalysis -64 -preprocess -setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false <file_name.c>

```
```
Developer:

An explicit-value domain stores explicit values for variables, not constraints,
and it does not keep track of relations between values. 
```
